# This file stores state machine that controls all the interaction process.
# First part of this file contains NODES of SM composed of:
# (int)ID;(String)NAME;(string)OUTPUT;(string)PARAMETERS
# The first node will be the starting node while nodes without successors
# will be terminal nodes.
# Node ID and Node NAME must be UNIQUE.
